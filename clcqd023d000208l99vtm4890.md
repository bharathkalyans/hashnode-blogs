# Arc Browser, the Google Chrome Killer?

* [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) by The Browser Company is one of the best browsers out there right now! I am not exaggerating 😮‍💨.
    
* Sadly, the browser is only available as a Beta version that too only for Mac users 😭 and it has a long waiting list as well.
    

### What is Arc Browser? 🌏

* It is like any other browser available in the market.
    
* It is a chromium-based browser like Microsoft Edge.
    
* The main goal of the browser is to show what is relevant and hide unwanted distractions.

* The above shows the official website page of the Arc Browser. The UI is free from unnecessary components which take up much of the space on your screen.
    
* You might wonder what is so cool about this browser? 🤔
    
* Until and unless you try it yourself you wouldn't get the feel of the browser.
    

### Features Offered 🔥

* Inbuilt ad blocker. You can disable this option if you wish to!
    
* Has an inbuilt **spotlight-like** feature. You can do anything with this awesome feature, like
    
    * Open any website just by simply typing the URL
        
    * Switch Tabs & Workspaces
        
    * Clear Cookies instantly

* There is an option to create **really handy workspaces**. Creating multiple workspaces segregates your day-to-day tasks. Work, Personal, and Upskilling are some custom examples.
    
* You can bundle a bunch of tabs together without the use of any external extensions and can visit anytime you wish to.
    
* My favorite is **split-wise**. You can split tabs (up to 3) and simultaneously work on all of them just by dragging them to the main window.

* And the amount of shortcuts you have is crazy. Anything which is done by mouse can be done by your keyboard. And the best part is you can alter shortcuts to your preferences and there are many more.
    

### Can it replace Chrome?

* My thoughts are that it is highly unlikely, but nothing's impossible. Even the CEO of The Browser Company told that they were not interested in beating Google Chrome and capturing their market share. He told that they want to provide a simple, modern, and easy-to-use product such that the users can benefit and do the most important thing they are using the browser for, i.e to surf the internet.
    
* This browser can be a great tool for Developers which is going to boost their productivity immensely.
