### What is API Design?

API design refers to the process of defining and creating an Application Programming Interface (API) that enables software components to communicate with each other. An API defines the set of rules and protocols for how different software components can interact with each other.

API design involves identifying the requirements of the API, defining the interface, and determining the functionality and behavior of the API. The goal of API design is to create an interface that is easy to understand, easy to use, and that meets the needs of its users.

### Good API Design Practices

Sure, here are a few examples of good API design practices:

1. Consistency: A good example of consistency in API design is the use of standardized HTTP verbs for API operations. For example, the HTTP GET verb is commonly used for retrieving data, while the HTTP POST verb is commonly used for creating new data. By adhering to these established conventions, developers can create APIs that are easy to understand and use.
    
    ```javascript
    // Using consistent HTTP verbs for API operations
    app.get('/api/v1/users/:userId', (req, res) => {
      // code to retrieve user data by userID
    });
    
    app.post('/api/v1/users?limit=10', (req, res) => {
      // code to get new users with a certain limit
    });
    
    app.post('/api/v1/users', (req, res) => {
      // code to create new user
    });
    ```
    
2. Simplicity: A good example of simplicity in API design is the use of clear and concise naming conventions for API endpoints and parameters. For example, an endpoint that retrieves a user's profile information could be named "/users/{userId}/profile", with clear and concise parameters such as "userId" and "includeInactive".
    
    ```javascript
    // Using clear and concise naming conventions for API endpoints and parameters
    app.get('/api/users/:userId/profile', (req, res) => {
      // code to retrieve user profile information
    });
    
    ```
    
3. Clarity: A good example of clarity in API design is the use of clear and concise documentation for the API. This can include API specifications, sample code, and usage examples, all of which can help developers understand the purpose and functionality of the API. API documentation plays a key role as other developers have to understand your API clearly.
    
    ```javascript
    // Clear and concise documentation for the API
    /**
     * @api {get} /api/users/:userId/profile Retrieve User Profile
     * @apiName GetUserProfile
     * @apiGroup Users
     *
     * @apiParam {Number} userId User's unique ID.
     *
     * @apiSuccess {String} name User's name.
     * @apiSuccess {String} email User's email.
     * @apiSuccess {String} address User's address.
     */
    app.get('/api/users/:userId/profile', (req, res) => {
      // code to retrieve user profile information
    });
    ```
    
4. Flexibility: A good example of flexibility in API design is the use of parameterized API endpoints that allow developers to customize the behavior of the API. For example, an API that retrieves a list of products could allow developers to specify filters and sorting criteria using query parameters, allowing them to retrieve only the data they need.
    
    ```javascript
    // Using parameterized API endpoints that allow developers to customize the behavior of the API
    app.get('/api/products', (req, res) => {
      const { filter, sortBy, sortOrder } = req.query;
      // code to retrieve products with optional filtering and sorting
    });
    ```
    
5. Scalability: A good example of scalability in API design is the use of asynchronous APIs that allow for parallel processing and can handle large volumes of data. For example, an API that retrieves data from a database could use asynchronous programming techniques to ensure that it can handle a large number of requests without impacting performance. You can use promises as well but stick to async and await as it is more clean and readable.
    
    ```javascript
    // API design using asynchronous APIs that can handle large volumes of data
    app.get('/api/products', async (req, res) => {
      const products = await Product.find().lean().exec();
      // code to process large amounts of data asynchronously
      res.send(products);
    });
    ```
    
6. Security: A good example of security in API design is the use of authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect the API from unauthorized access. This can include the use of API keys, OAuth 2.0, or other authentication protocols to ensure that only authorized users can access the API.
    
    ```javascript
    // Good API design using authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect the API from unauthorized access
    const passport = require('passport');
    const jwtStrategy = require('passport-jwt').Strategy;
    const { ExtractJwt } = require('passport-jwt');
    
    passport.use(new jwtStrategy({
      secretOrKey: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
      jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken()
    }, async (jwtPayload, done) => {
      const user = await User.findById(jwtPayload.sub);
      if (!user) {
        return done(null, false);
      }
      done(null, user);
    }));
    
    app.get('/api/users/:userId', passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false }), (req, res) => {
      // code to retrieve user data by ID, protected by authentication and authorization
    });
    ```
    
    You add an authentication function as a middleware to protect multiple endpoints at the same time.

Will be writing a new blog on how to name REST API endpoints.
