# How to make a ðŸ”¥ GitHub User Home Page

* The cover image of this blog shows a beautiful home page of my GitHub. For this, we will be using a special repository.
    
* In case you don't know, we can create a special repository with your \`username\` as the repositories name.
    

### Create Special Repository

* Create an account on GitHub if you don't have one and click on the option to create a new repository.
    
* Give the repository name as your username. (Repository name must be your username, else the markdown won't be visible on your user home page)
    
* Clone this repository to your favorite IDE.

* Create a file called \`README.md\` and a folder to store images.
    

### Edit README file

* Head to the following website and fill in the details whichever you want to show on your profile [GitHub Profile Read Me Generator by Rahul DK Jain](https://rahuldkjain.github.io/gh-profile-readme-generator/)
    
* Once you are done with it, click on generate readme and copy the markdown and head to your README.md file and copy it.
    
* Using IDEs like IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code gives you a preview of your markdown.
    
* Now to insert gifs or images we can use basic HTML tags.
    
* To create the header or images you want on your home page use the following website [UnDraw Open Source SVG Generator](https://undraw.co/). (Download the SVG format for better rendering of the image)
    
* Add the image to the images folder and push it to GitHub and copy the image URL and paste it into the src attribute of the image tag.

    ```
    
* Try to play with the markdown file and choose what fits best according to your preferences.
    
* Once you are satisfied with it push your changes to GitHub and visit your profile page.
    
* Voila, there you have your beautiful and eye-catching homepage.
    
* This is the markdown file I used for my GitHub [bharathkalyans markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharathkalyans/bharathkalyans/main/README.md), feel free to copy this and make changes incase you aren't comfortable with the README generator.
