* I barely prepared for a week and I used to spend around 3-4 hours at max and most of the time went for mocks.
    
* My approach was to take as many mocks as possible and figure out where I was weak. Later, I focused more on these weaker parts.
    
* Maps in listening and True/False/Not Given in reading were a nightmare for me. So, I primarily focused on these topics and practiced a lot.
    
* After a good amount of practice, I took the mocks provided by IELTS and scored a decent band of 7 - 7.5. In fact, I didn't expect I would be getting 8 bands. I scored a lot in listening but in my main test, I could only score 7.5. Not a big issue though after getting 8 bands overall.
    
* For Writing, I read multiple bands' essays and made my own template, and used that.
    
* For Speaking, I joined the below discord group and took multiple mocks.
    

Overall, I am very happy with the Band I received ðŸ˜„.
