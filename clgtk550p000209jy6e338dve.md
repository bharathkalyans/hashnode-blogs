* I have been searching for public APIs of leetcode for a personal project. But sadly couldn't find one that offered multiple endpoints.
    
* As a matter of fact, I found only a single service that offered only one endpoint.
    
* So, I created my own service using NodeJS & ExpressJS and deployed it on [@render](https://twitter.com/render) and [@cyclic\_sh](https://twitter.com/cyclic_sh).
    
* Deployed it on 2 separate service providers to balance the incoming requests in case a specific endpoint is taking a lot of time.
    
* Check out the source code and feel free to use these API's in your projects. I open-sourced it so you guys can contribute to it.
    
* Leetcode uses graphql to request user data from their servers. So I wanted to create this service which I wanted to use in a personal project.
    
* Hope people will like, use and contribute to this project.
